# Phone number Wordlist Generator v.0.1

A very flexible phone number wordlist generator based on Python.
Obviously, more than 30% users have their mobile phone numbers set as passwords.
Sometimes you need to get a phone-numbers based wordlist for choosen region, but you have a very slow internet connection.

This is a simple but flexible python script that allows you to operatively generate needed wordlist depending on your current situation.
For example, the new mobile network code appears in your country, you do not have to wait when a new wordlist appears, you can generate the new sequence with the new code in a new file, and append this file to your old wordlist using CLI.

Usage:

-Generates SNs (subscriber numbers) from 0000000 to 9999999 

-allows to add any prefixes (e.g CC, NDC)

-you have to set prefixes manually, just write them to the file "prefix.txt"
    
-each prefix should be written in a new line
    
-you can input the prefixes in any format (e.g 093, 8093, 8-093, +38(093) e.t.c)
                              
-if you dont want to use any prefixes, just leave the prefix.txt empty
    
-if you want to generate just one sequence without any prefix, one of the lines in prefix.txt should be empty.	

Launching:

-Download program

-cd to the program's directory

-put your custom prefixes in the file "prefix.txt"

-type:
    python3 pnwgen.py
